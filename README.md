# 🎮 Ludo Game App – Technical Overview

📱 Project Overview

The Ludo Game App is a multi-platform Flutter application that modernizes the traditional Ludo
experience with real-time multiplayer simulation, wallet-based payment integration, and responsive
UI.
It demonstrates game development, mobile architecture design, payment integration, and state
management in a single production-ready project.

🏗️ Architecture & Tech Stack
Core Technologies

Flutter SDK (3.9+) – Cross-platform framework

Flame Game Engine – 2D game rendering and animations

Provider Pattern – Efficient state management

Custom Responsive System – Scales UI across devices

Key Dependencies
Package Description
flame: ^1.32.0 Game engine for board rendering and animations
flame_audio: ^2.11.10 Audio system for in-game effects
provider: ^6.1.2 State management
flutter_svg: ^2.2.1 SVG rendering support
🎯 Key Features
🧩 1. Core Gameplay

Flame-based game engine for smooth 2D board interactions

Multiplayer support (2–4 players) with team selection

Interactive dice system with animations

Token movement system with predefined Ludo paths

Game state management using Provider for turn tracking

🧠 The Ludo board rendering and movement logic were adapted from an open-source GitHub project to
save time during development. I integrated this logic with my custom UI, state management, and
payment features.

📱 2. Responsive Design System

Custom responsive utility (Responsive.dart)

Automatic UI scaling using width ratio (width / 411)

Cross-device compatibility from mobile to desktop

Adaptive layouts for dynamic element positioning

💰 3. Wallet & Payment Integration

Coin-based economy with real-time balance updates

Multiple payment options (UPI, card, net banking – simulated)

Coin packages (100–10,000 coins)

Entry fee system for joining matches

Automatic coin deduction and refund handling

👥 4. Social & Real-time Features

Player profiles with expandable details

Emoji reactions (6 types) for in-game interactions

Live dice and turn indicators for real-time feedback

🎨 5. UI/UX Excellence

Modern dark-blue theme with gradients

Smooth animations and transitions

Custom reusable widgets (Dice, Board, Wallet, etc.)

Accessible design with proper color contrast and touch areas

🔧 Technical Highlights
Game Engine
class Ludo extends FlameGame with HasCollisionDetection, TapDetector {
// Custom game logic, collision detection, and animations
}

Responsive System
class Responsive {
double get width => MediaQuery.of(context).size.width;
late double scale = width / 411;
}

State Management
class CoinManager extends ChangeNotifier {
// Manages wallet coins and payment logic
}

💻 GitHub Acknowledgment

The Ludo board and movement logic were adapted from an open-source GitHub project to accelerate
development.
I focused on building the complete Flutter app layer, including:

UI/UX design

Payment & wallet system

Responsive layout system

State management (Provider)

Integration of Flame logic with Flutter components

This approach reflects real-world software practices — using open-source resources responsibly while
building a complete, functional, and production-ready application.

🎯 Takeaway

This project showcases:

End-to-end app development capability

Integration of game logic with Flutter architecture

Strong understanding of responsive design & state management

Business mindset with monetization integration
